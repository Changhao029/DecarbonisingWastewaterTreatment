By clicking the blue navigation bar on the left side of the page, the user can jump to either the "data display" or "visualization page" pages.

At the top of the data display page, users can input related information into the search bars to search for the data they want. The user can see the search result by clicking the "query" button, and the result will be shown as a table and displayed at the centre of the page. 

In the upper right corner of the data table, there is a "download" button. Users can click this button to download all the data or the query result data as a CSV file.

## Data Visualization page:
